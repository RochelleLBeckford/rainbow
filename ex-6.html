            <ul>
                <li>
                    When building a webpage, styling it with colors can help make it even more beautiful and unique
                </li>
                <li>
                    To add color to text, use the "color" property
                </li>
                <li>
                    A common way to do this in CSS is by naming them with English words:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/c-colors-syntax.png"
                                alt="Syntax to add colors to text in CSS"
                                class="css-img"
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>

        <!-- & This section will discuss RGB colors -->
        <section>
            <h2>RGB</h2>
            <hr class="section-title-divider">

            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are other ways to customize colors, such as RGB
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is the most popular one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It represents the intensity of the red-ness, green-ness, and blue-ness of the color(s) that we assign to a given element
                </li>
                <li>
                    The rgb() function accepts three integers ranging from 0 to 255 (0 has no intensity and 255 has maximum intensity), and is assigned to the "color" property:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/d-rgb-syntax.png"
                                alt="Syntax for how to use RGB in CSS"
                                class="css-img"
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This can be alternatively be expressed with hexidecimals (aka hexicode) that begins with a hastag (#), followed by a combination of numbers (0 - 9) and letters (a - f):
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <img
                                src="img/e-hexicode-syntax.png"
                                alt="Syntax for colors using Hexicode in CSS"
                                class="css-img"
                            >
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The letters in hexidecimals can either be lowercase or uppercase
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Mixing cases are possible, but it is best practice is to use either all lowercase or all uppercase in hexidecimals
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
